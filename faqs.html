            To be eligible for a work visa to teach in China you will need the following 3 things as a minimum: a bachelor’s degree, a clean police check, and a 120-hour TEFL/ TESOL certification OR a reference letter evidencing 2 years of ESL teaching experience.<br><br>

            As before, these are the minimum requirements – teaching experience and a higher education level will likely give you access to higher paid roles. For example, to work in an international school a teacher typically needs to hold qualified teacher status in their home country, as well as several years of classroom experience. A university teaching role typically requires a minimum of 2 years of professional work or teaching experience.<br><br>

            The minimum requirements for a work ‘Z’ visa in China are a bachelor’s degree, a clean police check and a 120-hour online TEFL/ TESOL certification. These 3 documents must be notarized and authenticated (legalized). We welcome applicants to apply before completing their TEFL course, and up to 9 months before completing their degree.<br><br>

            Teachers with 2 years of classroom teaching experience and a reference letter to evidence this do not require a TEFL certification for the purposes of the work visa.<br><br>

            Of course, many schools set experience and qualification pre-requisites. For example, many Chinese universities have a policy which requires that their ESL teachers have 2 years of classroom experience, due to the higher level of teaching and language level of their students. International Schools typically require teachers to hold a teaching licence from their home country or a Master’s degree in Education etc.

            Opportunity China’s Coordinators are here to guide and support you through the process, so you are clear on what to do at every step of the way. In addition to this, we provide various online resources and tailored guidance as per the requirements of your employer school.<br><br>

            In short, you will first gather your bachelor’s certificate, police check and TEFL certificate/ reference letter. Then, you will get these 3 documents notarized by a notary or lawyer. Following that, the documents are sent to the relevant State/Foreign Office. Finally, you will take the documents to your nearest Chinese Embassy for the final authentication stage. Find a detailed, country by country guide to authentication here.<br><br>

            Once complete, you then email scans of these documents to your employer school in China, and they will apply for your work permit.<br><br>

            Then you need to be patient…

            3- 4 weeks later, the work permit will be issued electronically and emailed to you.<br><br>

            You can then use this work permit paperwork and apply for a z visa at your nearest Visa for China Service Centre. You’ll need to take all original authenticated documents with you to China.<br><br>

            Yes, at some point a medical check will be required, although it’s nothing to worry about.<br><br>

            Approximately 80% of schools will require you to complete a medical check in your country of residence as part of the work visa process. Often the Chinese Medical Form can be completed in quite a basic way by a Nurse or Physician from your existing medical notes, without any tests being done.<br><br>

            Other schools will only require the medical check to be completed on arrival in China, and will arrange this for you.<br><br>

            Even if you have a medical check in your home country before you depart, you will likely need to have a second medical check upon arrival in China.<br><br>

            In public and international schools, teachers have the same holidays as students – so a 3 week break over Chinese New Year (typically February) and the summer off work (July and August), depending when your contract term starts and ends. Check to see what salary arrangements are during vacation periods. Plus, a minimum 11 days of public holiday.<br><br>

            In private language centres teacher have 11 days of public holidays off work, plus usually a minimum of 2 weeks paid vacation taken at a time of your choice. Some schools may also have an additional week of closure over Chinese New Year.

            Yes, all schools either provide an apartment or give a monthly accommodation allowance. The apartment will be modern, comfortable and practical located within 20 minutes of your workplace and often shared with one other teacher. Where an apartment is provided, either Opportunity China or your employer school will be able to show you sample apartment photos.<br><br>

            When an accommodation allowance is provided, this is typically for two-thirds of the cost of a standard one-bedroom apartment that city. A school will typically provide hotel accommodation for 4-5 nights while their bi-lingual staff assist you to apartment hunt. Most schools will also offer an interest-free start up loan to assist with some of the up-front costs of the deposit and rental, often between RMB6000- 10000.

            All teachers need to cover the following costs up-front: document notarization and authentication costs (actual cost depends on your country of residence), visa application (approximately US$175/ £150) and international flight.<br><br>

            All schools will reimburse the international flight as per the conditions of the employment contract; some will reimburse shortly after arrival, others in instalments, others at the end of the contract.<br><br>

            Some schools will also reimburse certain document authentication costs.<br><br>

            You will also need sufficient funds to live on during your first few weeks, prior to being paid. The exact amount will depend on the city of work – your Opportunity China Coordinator will be able to advise you.

            Yes, it’s standard practice that teachers pay for their flight to China up-front. This will later be reimbursed as per the conditions of your contract; the majority either reimburse in instalments or at the end of contract, however a small number reimburse within a month of arrival.
